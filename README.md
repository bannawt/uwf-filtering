# Deep Learning Based Image Filtering System

A script that trains an InceptionResNetV2 model to detect and filter out poor quality ultrawide field (UWF) images for subsequent AI diagnostic systems.
The model was trained on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit with a NVidia Tesla V100 16GB GPU.
Dependencies include Keras 2.2.4 and Tensorflow 1.13.1. Please refer to https://keras.io and https://tensorflow.org for more details.
